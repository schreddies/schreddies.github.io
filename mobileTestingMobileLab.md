# Mobile Testing Mobile Lab on macos
## Intro
More and more companies starting their life with the mobile applications. Comparably many other, well seated companies, tries to enlarge bussiness portfolio by developing new mobile apps. It makes a little harder job for testing, especially the black box security testing. So here you have small notebook how to do it or some ideas how to achive more in your specific scenario.
## Hardware
To achive our goal in making 'the lab' as mobile as possible. However not in inconvinient way - without stripping the plastic housing or having some gizmo looking pcb in metal box from mints. And fairly cheap. List goes liek this:
* Wireless access point Mikrotik RBmAPL-2nD https://mikrotik.com/product/RBmAPL-2nD
* USB Micro B cable (for power)
* powerbank (for power)
* USB-C to ethernet adapter (the most expensive part here, but mac compatibility does not come cheap) https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F2CU040/
* The shortest ethernet cable I was able to find in the 'computer waste bin'
